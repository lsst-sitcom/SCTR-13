\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}


\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

The purpose of this test plan is to verify combined control and combined
interlocks of the Camera Rotator integrated with the Camera Cable Wrap
at the Summit facility, as defined in \citeds{LTS-160}, \citeds{LTS-206} and \citeds{LTS-218}. The
combined control will be accomplished through SAL v4.0 utilizing the
LSST pointing component and Jupyter notebooks. This following criteria
must be met in order to execute this test campaign:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Requires the use of the encoders and a laser tracker only
\item
  Does \textbf{NOT} require the camera rotator to be loaded with the
  camera simulated mass or actual camera hardware
\end{itemize}



\subsection{System Overview}
\label{sect:systemoverview}

The Camera Cable Wrap is mounted to one side of the Integrating
Structure with the Camera Hexapod and Rotator installed on the other
side of the Integrating Structure. This assembly is mounted onto the
Camera Cart when it is off of the telescope. The primary function of the
Camera Cable Wrap is to rotate in a synchronous fashion with the Camera
Rotator to prevent the utilities from getting damaged.

testing of the CCW Integration with the Camera rotator and the camera
cart.

\paragraph{Test Case LVV-T1567 - Integration of Camera Rotator with SAL 4.0 (MOOG)
 }\mbox{}\\

Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T1567}{\textit{ LVV-T1567 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case is to verify the software requirements
of the camera rotator integrated with SAL 4.0 as defined in \citeds{LTS-160} \&
\citeds{LTS-206}. This test case will only exercise the functionality that was
executed previously and meets the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Requires the rotator to be operable
\item
  Requires the Camera Rotator to able to receive commands from SAL 4.0
\item
  Does \textbf{NOT~}require the rotator to be loaded with the camera
  simulated mass or actual camera hardware
\end{itemize}

The software functional requirements were previously re-verified during
a test campaign at the Summit without the use of SAL. The test procedure
used during the re-verification testing was the \emph{LSST
Hexapods-Rotator Software Acceptance Test Procedure.~}This test is meant
to confirm that the Camera Rotator is functioning correctly with the new
version of SAL. The test steps of this test case are taken directly from
that document on how to perform the test in a similar way as was
performed previously and includes changes noted by the
vendor.\\[2\baselineskip]See the attached \emph{LSST Rotator Operator's
Manual} for more information on how to operate the rotator.


\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
Prior to the execution of this test case, the following Summit tasks
must be completed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The functional testing of the Camera Rotator Hardware~

 }\mbox{}\\

Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T1569}{\textit{ LVV-T1569 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case is to verify the interlocks of the
integrated CCW and Camera Rotator. This test case will exercise the
functionality of the combined interlock system between the CCW and the
Camera Rotator and meets the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Requires CCW AUX IS to be connected to the Camera Rotator IS
\item
  Requires WOBBLE assembly to be electrically and mechanically connected
\item
  Does \textbf{NOT} require the camera rotator to be loaded with the
  camera simulated mass or actual camera hardware
\item
  Does \textbf{NOT~}require CCW and Camera Rotator to be under combined
  control
\end{itemize}

The interlock system requirements for the Camera Rotator were previously
verified during the software functional re-verification test at the
summit facility. The test procedure used during the re-verification
testing is the \emph{LSST Hexapods-Rotator Software Acceptance Test
Procedure} which is attached to this test case. This includes the
procedure that covered how the interlocks were triggered for the Camera
Rotator, however it is a different configuration with the CCW
integrated.


\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
Prior to the execution of this test case to verify the interlocks of the
CCW + HR, the following Summit tasks must be completed:\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The CCW has been installed on the Camera Cart

  \begin{itemize}
